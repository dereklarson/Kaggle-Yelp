# Kaggle-Yelp
Simple, effective model analyzing the data from the Yelp recruiting competition on Kaggle. This achieves about rank 20 on the private leaderboard.

It's a work in progress, playing around with it when I have some time. Currently it only uses ~15 features from user/business statistics and simple text analysis.
